Colafelice,1 R. Mastrosanti,2 M. Ciabattini,2 M. Maurici,2 F. Lauria,1 L. Morciano,2 F. Lucaroni2\\n1 Sant’Eugenio Hospital\\n2 University of Rome Tor Vergata\\nIntroduction\\nAnaemia is a widespread disease, globally affecting almost 2 \\nbillion individuals and therefore being considered an important \\nhealth burden.\\n1 Mild, moderate and severe anaemia together de-\\ntermine over 60 million years of life lived with disability (YLDs) \\nall over the world. Only in Italy, it has been estimated that anae-\\nmia affects nearly 20% of the entire population,\\n2 with prevalence \\nrate rapidly increasing by age, exceeding 40% in individuals who \\nare older than 80 years, in particular among the hospitalised pa-\\ntients.\\n3 According to international studies, 58.4% to 74% of in-\\npatients, including those with normal Hb levels at the hospital \\nadmission, have anaemia.\\n4-6 Besides being a common disorder, \\nnot only in older people, anaemia can rapidly develop to multiple \\nco-morbidities and to the impairment of self-sufficiency.\\n7,8\\nMoreover, it is often an under-reported disease, both in out-\\npatients and inpatients, because it is rarely considered as a main \\npathological entity. Therefore, except in the cases of acute blood \\nloss, it may remain untreated.\\n9\\nAnaemia is then associated with the increase in healthcare \\nservices utilisation and with the worsening of different health \\noutcomes, irrespective of the reasons of hospital admission: it \\ncontributes to delay hospital discharge and to increase mortality \\nand morbidity rates,\\n4-6,9 thus leading to the rise of the economic \\nburden of disease, due both to direct and indirect costs of anae-\\nmia.\\n10 \\nIn recent years, there is a growing awareness of a pathoge-\\nnetic association between frailty and anaemia in the elderly, and \\ncurrent scientific evidence highlights the role of anaemia as an \\nearly biomarker of frailty condition.\\n9,11,12\\nAnaemia is defined by low amount of red blood cells (RBCs) \\nor insufficient haemoglobin (Hb) levels for physiological needs. \\nAccording to WHO,13 the Hb threshold values to diagnose anae-\\nmia are 13 g/dL for men and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, \\nwith age difference and severity stratification, as shown in Table 1.\\nThe most frequent cause of anaemia is nutrient deficiency, in \\nparticular iron deficiency, though many conditions, going from \\nchronic diseases to infections, may contribute to determine it.\\n14,15\\nAnaemia is often a predictable and relatively simply treatable \\ndisorder, by administration of micronutrients,9,16-19 and its preva-\\nlence could be significantly reduced by the introduction of spe-\\ncific diagnostic and treatment pathways, in a multi-dimensional \\napproach, involving also General Practitioners and Local Health \\nUnits.\\n9\\nThe aim of the study is to examine anaemia profiles as in-\\ndependent predictors of increased length of hospital stay (LOS) \\nand in-hospital mortality through the analysis of administrative \\ndata in an Italian Hospital and to compare anaemia with other \\ncommon chronic pathologic conditions which are known to be \\nassociated with a LOS increase, including dementia,\\n20 respiratory \\nimpairments,21 diabetes22 and chronic kidney failure.23\\nMaterial and Methods\\nA monocentric observational retrospective study was performed \\nin 2016 in Sant’ Eugenio Hospital, a public hospital in Rome \\nwith nearly 570 ordinary beds. All the discharge from 01/01/2016 \\nto 12/31/2016 were evaluated, irrespective from main diagnosis, \\nage or gender. Only ordinary admissions of patients aged over 14 \\nwere taken into consideration for the analysis.\\nChronic diseases investigated as predictive factors for high \\nLOS and increased in-hospital mortality are listed in Table 2, \\nwith their specific ICD-9 CM codes. Diagnoses were defined ac-\\ncording to primary and secondary diagnoses at discharge. In case \\nTable 1.

Population sample was con-\\nstituted by 55.9% (N=6,475) of women and 44.1% (N=5,104) \\nof men, with a mean age of 62.6 (SD ±20.3) years and a median \\nof 67 (IQ 46-79). Furthermore, the most part of them (57.5%, \\nN=6,655) had high educational level (High School Diploma or \\nabove).\\nAn overall number of 1,065 (9.2%) hospital stays showed \\nanaemia, according to discharge records. The most part of codi-\\nfied cases were chronic anaemias (42.1%, N=448), followed by \\n21.8% (N=232) deficiency anaemias, and 2.1 % (N=22) thalas-\\nsemia. One case by three (N=363) was recorded as “other types \\nof anaemias” (data not shown).\\nInpatients had an average LOS of 8.26 (SD ±9.63) days, \\ntherefore prolonged LOS corresponded to an hospital stay equal \\nor over 18 days. Those with high LOS, accounting to nearly 10% \\nof the population sample, were older: they had a mean age of \\n68.9 (SD ±17.4) years compared with 61.9 (SD ±20.5) of pa-\\ntients with lower LOS (p value 0.000, by ANOV A test) (data not \\nshown).\\nNearly 1 patient out of 2 (48.5%) was discharged home, \\nwhereas assisted discharge accounted for 32.9%, transfers to oth-\\ner institutes for 9.4% and 5.8% of admissions resulted in in-hos-\\npital deaths.\\nProlonged LOS was statistically significant associated with a \\nnumber of comorbidities. Chronic anaemia, respiratory impair -\\nment and deficiency anaemia showed the strongest association, \\nwith adjusted Odds Ratios (AORs) of 5.236 [95%CI 4.230-\\n6.481], 3.614 [95%CI 3.063-4.264] and 2.137 [95%CI 1.518-\\n3.008], respectively (Table 3). Conversely, no significant associ-\\nation with gender and educational level emerged.\\nConcerning the impact of comorbidities on in-hospital death, \\nthe role of chronic anaemia decreased in magnitude [OR 1.562; \\n95%CI 1.085-2.250], whereas the impact of respiratory impair -\\nment became four times higher [OR 12.856; 95%CI 10.785-\\n15.326]. All the other assessed anaemia profiles showed no \\nstatistically significant association with mortality (see Table 4). \\nNot surprisingly, the risk of death during hospital stay increased \\namong elderly people.\\nDiscussion\\nStrenghts and limitations\\nBy the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies com-\\nprehensively assessing anaemia profiles as independent risk fac-\\ntors for both LOS and in-hospital mortality in Italy. However, \\nthe study presents some limitations. Anaemia was only defined \\naccording to discharge records, although some recent evidence \\nshows the high underestimate of anaemia cases exclusively based \\non administrative data.\\n9 Comparing Hb levels both at admission \\nand discharge would be more useful to define the magnitude of \\nanaemia prevalence, eventually achieving also stratification by \\nseverity (i.e. mild, moderate or severe anaemia).\\n9\\nChronic diseases were defined by the evaluation of primary \\ndiagnosis and one of the five secondary diagnoses, thus not con-\\nsidering all the diagnostic codes included in discharge records. \\nTable 2.

This limitation \\nmight explain the low overall prevalence of anaemia (9.2%), \\ncompared with international data, ranging between 58.4% to \\n74%.\\n4-6 \\nSynthesis of the results\\nAmong the chronic diseases with highest prevalence, anaemia \\nbehave as the strongest independent risk factor, both for long \\nin-hospital stay and for in-hospital mortality. Respiratory impair-\\nment only impacted more than anaemia on inpatients mortality. \\nDeficiency anaemia, the profile accounting the most part of anae-\\nmia diagnoses at discharge, is an independent risk factor only \\nfor prolonged in-hospital stay, whereas no statistically significant \\nassociation was found with in-hospital mortality. Conversely, \\nanaemia due to chronic disorders showed a relevant impact on \\nboth outcomes.\\nOur results on mortality are consistent with other internation-\\nal data. In two elderly cohorts, anaemia was found to be signifi-\\ncantly associated with a relative risk of death of 1.61, [95% CI \\n1.34-1.93]\\n24 and a mortality risk of 1.60 [95% CI 1.24-2.06].25\\nChronic anaemia increased more than 5 times the risk of hav-\\ning a hospital stay longer than 18 days, irrespectively from age \\nand gender. These results show the same direction of scientif-\\nic evidence, although they don’t have the same magnitude: re-\\ncent studies showed an increased risk of prolonged LOS ranging \\nfrom 1.37 [95%CI 1.01 - 1.79] for all anaemias\\n4 to 2.18 [95%CI \\n2.11-2.26] for moderate/severe anaemias, 26 with a median LOS \\nincrease of 1.5 days by unit of Hb decrease.27 \\nThe difference in magnitude is partially explainable by the \\nchoice of the Authors to evaluate the different profiles of anaemia \\nas independent risk factors for negative in-hospital outcomes. \\nFurthermore, in the advanced age groups, where anaemia has the \\nhighest prevalence, a relationship with a more complex condition, \\nfrailty, should be considered, as recent studies suggest.\\n12 Indeed, \\nfrailty and chronic anaemia share a common pathogenic path, \\ncharacterised by chronic inflammation, induced by immuno-se-\\nnescence associated changes and oxidative stress.\\n12 Deficiency \\nanaemia also might be indirectly affected by the interaction with \\nfrailty and chronic anaemia. Indeed, these two anaemia profiles \\nare physio-pathologically associated entities: frail subjects with \\nchronic anaemia show an increase in hepcidin, a peptide inhib-\\niting the release of iron from depots, inducing functional iron \\ndeficiency.\\n12 \\nSince the complexity of the pathogenetic interaction, it could \\nbe promising to investigate anaemia, by Hb levels evaluation, to-\\ngether with a number of possible proxy of frailty, such as blood \\nalbumin, creatinine, BUN, GOT and GPT, in order to build a \\nfrailty predictive index or to integrate Frailty Risk Index\\n12,28 with \\nlaboratory parameters routinely measured. \\nConclusions \\nThere is plenty of studies available showing the negative impact \\nof anaemia on different health outcomes, but few considering \\nanaemia profiles as independent risk factors. In this study we \\nobserved how the magnitude of the association with negative \\ninpatients health outcomes substantially increases when specific \\nanaemia profiles are considered as independent factors. This is \\ntrue in particular for anaemia induced by chronic disease, prob-\\nably for the complexity of the disorders included in this clas-\\nsification, and to a lesser extent for deficiency anaemia. Since \\nthe availability of effective therapies, in particular for deficiency \\ndisorders, early identification of people at risk, through an active \\n“case finding” in the hospital using risk prediction tools, might \\nbe considered nowadays a main strategy to reduce in-hospital \\nmortality and prolonged hospital length of stay. Furthermore, \\nhospitals are not the proper settings for treatment of such com-\\nplex disorders. Patients-targeted therapeutic paths should be built \\nat the outpatient care level, in order to manage patients with a \\nmulti-dimensional approach, involving General Practitioners, \\nfamily nurses, nutritionists and other healthcare professionals. \\n1.

According to \\nUNAIDS, in the east and south Africa regions HIV prevalence \\nin people from 15 to 49 years was 7.0% (6.8%-7.7%). Mozam-\\nbique’s HIV prevalence is 12.3% (10.6% - 18.9%), the eighth \\nhighest in the world (UNAIDS, 2017; UNICEF, 2017).\\nAs of 2018, 2.2 million people live with HIV in Mozambique \\nwith 150,000 newly infected people per year.\\n1 Women are dispro-\\nportionately affected: about 60% of the adults living with HIV are \\nwomen, and new infections among young women (ages 15-24) \\nwere almost double compared to young men. More than 95% of \\npregnant women living with HIV were able to access ART to pre-\\nvent transmission to the new-borns, preventing therefore about \\n18,000 new HIV infections per year among infants. In terms of \\ncoverage of health facilities offering HIV treatment in Mozam-\\nbique, based on a 2020 Minister of Health (MISAU) report, from \\n2003 to 2020 Mozambique reached a 95% coverage. This means \\nthat from 1,721 existing public health facilities, 1,633 offer HIV \\ntreatment at different levels (MISAU, 2020:47). However, life-\\nlong antiretroviral treatment is often associated with high levels \\nof interruption, abandonment, and loss to follow up (LTFU).\\n2,3,4\\nThis article discusses the phenomenon of people abandoning \\nHIV-AIDS treatment in three health centres in Mozambique. It \\nresults from researches carried out in urban and rural contexts, \\nrelated to a doctorate degree on “Language, Culture and Society” \\nat the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanity at the Zambeze \\nUniversity, in Mozambique. \\nIn 2021, the Southern African Development Community \\n(SADC) has estimated that 45 million people are starving in the \\nregion. Draught, floods, and the Covid-19 pandemic are some \\nof the causes of the tragedy. Furthermore, there is lack of food \\ncaused by climate changes. The Global Report on Food Crises \\n2020\\n5 reveals that many Mozambican people, particularly un-\\nder-5 children, present with acute malnutrition. The tropical \\ncyclones Idai and Kenneth have destroyed vast agricultural ar -\\neas, affecting family incomes. Moreover, the same report states \\nthat the floods and draughts in different geographical areas have \\nfurther exacerbated malnutrition. The environment factor consti-\\ntutes the core reason why the agriculture production in Mozam-\\nbique is not coping with the basic food needs of the population. \\nSome years ago, the main problem was of lack of nutritional \\neducational. As Germano et al. (2007, p.21) argued “often in Af-\\nrica food that is both abundant and cheap is not used in people’s \\ndiet although it may be highly nutritious. People ignore it be-\\ncause they fail to realize their importance”. Today, although this \\nsituation is still present in some areas, the problem seems to be a \\ndifferent one. There have been significant changes in nutritional \\nconcepts, especially among women who participated, when vis-\\niting health centres, in cooking sessions to learn good practices \\nby using cheaper and local products. These sessions continue to \\ntake place in different health centres. However, today, especially \\nin Mangunde health centre, one may hardly deliver such sessions \\nto patients who have no food at all. The response to this problem \\nmust be approached differently, i.e. providing food to rural com-\\nmunities strongly affected by climate changes. \\nMethods\\nPopulation\\nThis descriptive study, based on interviews, has been conducted \\nfrom June to August 2021. Overall, the study involved 82 indi-\\nviduals on HIV-AIDS treatment, as well as 70 people sampled \\nfrom the health staff (including trained volunteers). Patients in-\\nvolved in the study were those who restarted treatment after they \\nhad abandoned it. These people had been previously selected by \\nthe health centre authorities through an existing list of patients \\nwith a history of abandonment. Moreover, this paper focuses also \\non hunger and nomadism as possible social determinants of HIV/\\nAIDS treatment abandonment. Treatment abandonment, defined \\nas the failure to start or complete a programme of a potentially \\ncurative therapy, is a frequent but preventable cause of treatment \\nfailure among children, as well as adults.\\n6 \\nBrief evolution of Antiretroviral \\nTreatment in Mozambique\\nThe Mozambican government is dealing with treatment of HIV \\nsince 2003, when the Community of Sant´Egidio, introduced \\nthe DREAM (Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and \\nMalnutrition) programme in Maputo. At that time, many orga-\\nnizations considered inappropriate to introduce treatment. The \\nfocus was only prevention by means of condoms. As affirmed \\nby Palombi et al., “In the history of the medicine, no epidemy \\nhas been quelled exclusively through prevention. The exclusion \\nof the Africans in the treatment is simply due to lack of will […]'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2021-11-09T10:52:25+01:00', 'moddate': '2021-11-09T10:52:26+01:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.0000000DD.pdf', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2021\\n2\\nPoverty, Illiteracy, Hunger and Nomadism as Social,  \\nCultural and Economic Reasons of Treatment Abandonment in HIV/AIDS Patients in Mozambique\\nmoreover, the inefficiency of the drugs due to malnutrition and \\npolluted water may be overcome altogether with domiciliary \\ntreatment if also food support and drinking water are guaran-\\nteed”, (Palombi, 2008:45).\\n7 In countries like Mozambique, inef-\\nficient health systems, delayed diagnosis, lack of physicians and \\nnurses, inadequate supportive care infrastructure, limited access \\nto effective treatment, high rates of treatment-related mortality, \\nincreased relapse, and treatment abandonment are common rea-\\nsons for poor survival rates.\\n8 The treatment of HIV introduced by \\nthe Community of Sant’Egidio in Mozambique is free of charge, \\nso to allow everyone getting treated and not abandoning it due \\nto lack of money. As it has been maintained, “A free of charge \\ntreatment is beforehand a matter of justice, but the aim is also to \\nsupport patients to follow the therapy without interrupting it. In \\nfact, the few lucky people in Africa (the ones with money to start \\nthe therapy) often interrupt it because they get into economic \\ndifficulties with enormous prejudice to the therapy response and \\nensuing resistance to successive therapies. For DREAM, gratuity \\nand inclusion of those who present with clinical criteria to be in-\\ncluded in the programme is a matter of justice, but also backbone \\nto guarantee adherence to therapy” (DREAM, 2008:71).\\n9\\nBut why African governments and the international commu-\\nnity hesitated to introduce antiretroviral treatment in Mozam-\\nbique? According to Germano et al (2007:13) “Failure to adhere \\nto therapy has long been one of the main obstacles to introducing \\nanti-retroviral therapy in resource-limited countries”. While the \\ninternational wavering continued, rich people were treated and \\npoor people were dying without even being tested.\\nBefore the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, there was \\na need of convincing the international community and agencies \\nabout the approach to be considered for developing countries. \\nIt was clear that rich countries could better afford the treatment \\nthan poor ones, however, something had to be done to save Af-\\nrican lives. According to Marazzi (2009:7),\\n10 “In fact, an AIDS \\npatient has an individual complexity, is not a photocopy of pa-\\ntients who live in rich countries, must be known, studied and we \\nmust answer to his or her specific needs in preventive, therapeu-\\ntics and social terms…” This assumption fostered the ongoing \\nof the DREAM program for Africa, confident that treating AIDS \\nin Africa would not simply mean the provision of drugs, but also \\nnutritional support and other kinds of assistance. Before intro-\\nducing antiretrovirals in Mozambique, patients infected by HIV \\nused to go to South Africa or other countries, but this was possi-\\nble only for rich people. Thus, the majority of the infected poor \\npeople were receiving a sort of death sentence. “Rurality and \\npoverty often coincide. The rural environment is often charac-\\nterized by cultural and existential isolation, hard life conditions, \\nlack of transport means, lack of communication, schools, and \\nsanitation. All these often generate a one sense response: flee \\nfrom countryside and a disordered and rapid urbanization which \\ncreates impossible megapoles”, Alumando, (2009:57). From \\n2003 to 2021 the government has greatly expanded antiretrovi-\\nral treatment. According to a MISAU report from 2020, out of \\n1,633 health facilities with ARV treatment, 38 are closed (35 in \\nCabo Delgado and 3 in Sofala provinces), (MISAU, 2020:54). \\nAccording to the same MISAU report, the number of people liv-\\ning with HIV and in ARV treatment has increased: “up to the \\nend of December 2020, a total of 1,402,902 patients are report-\\ned in active treatment, compared to 1,338,100 active patients at \\nthe end of 2019”, (MISAU, 2020:48). The national treatment \\ncoverage is 68%. However, in the Sofala province, only 55% of \\nthe infected people are on treatment. That is, about half of the \\ninfected people are still not being treated.\\nAdherence and treatment abandonment\\nAntiretroviral treatment is for the moment a treatment for life. \\nIts interruption causes complications and is usually fatal. A \\nmonitoring carried out in 595 health facilities shows that 72-\\n85% of the patients who started ARV treatment continue the \\ntreatment after 30 days, on one hand, and from 79-90% of the \\npatients continue the treatment after a period of three months. \\nSumming up, the average of adherence after one and three \\nmonths is 82% and 85%, respectively (MISAU, 2020:52). What \\nkeeps adherence to treatment is not just the availability of the \\ndrugs or the infrastructures. More importantly, as Germano et \\nal state, “confidentiality, respect, courtesy, availability of staff, \\nand a pleasant, welcoming environment… are all factors that \\ncontribute to patients’ decision to return to the centres for suc-\\ncessive treatments” (Germano et al, 2007:13). These factors are \\nimportant for both the comfort of the patients and the psycho-\\nlogical aptitude for adherence. \\nThe causes of abandonment may vary according to the spe-\\ncific country and within the same country, particularly when it \\nundergoes economic and demographic transitions.\\n11 “The follow \\nup of the adherence is crucial to avoid absences and abandons, \\nas well as to reinforce adherence, assuring the improvement of \\nthe quality of life of the patients in ARV treatment. It is neces-\\nsary that the monthly calendar is fulfilled in the first three months \\nfrom the beginning of the ARV treatment, followed by a trimes-\\ntral follow up.”, (MISAU, 2020:66).\\n12 That is why patients’ visits \\nare scheduled appropriately. There are trained volunteers who \\nassure the follow-up of the patients, calling by phone those who \\nmiss to come to an appointment at the health centre. However, \\nthe number of patients who don’t show up or abandon contin-\\nues to rise. “Adherence to treatment is one of the most critical \\naspects of a public health approach to HIV control in Africa. In \\nthe experience of DREAM, a high level of adherence arises from \\ntwo factors: assurance of access to treatment; and free of charge \\ntreatment.” (Marazzi et all, 2005:19). \\nDescriptive Outcomes\\nA 50-year-old patient at Mangunde health centre said: “In the \\ncountryside there is no job. The unique job is to go to Machamba \\n(agriculture) to work for others and get paid. Often, we go out-\\nside Mangunde to find this job and this is what happened to me. \\nI was out and didn’t manage to come and take drugs for three \\nmonths”. Such stories are very common for both men and women \\nin Mangunde. The patients are conscious of the importance of \\nthe treatment, but their daily struggle for surviving or get stuff to \\neat doesn’t make them stable. As Bernard Tondé (2016:328) says \\n“AIDS is also a rural problem, not because it ruins sustainable \\ndevelopment efforts but also because it threatens food security, \\nhitting agriculture by disseminating the workforce”. For such \\nreasons, an integrated approach in treating HIV patients becomes \\nimportant for the success of the treatment, especially in rural ar -\\neas like Mangunde. The patient on treatment and with lack of \\nfood will not only interrupt the treatment, but will also, as a con-\\nsequence of the disease, fail to continue to work. Another pa-\\ntient in the Mangunde health centre said: “Our biggest problem \\nis scarcity of rain and, consequently, we have worse harvestings, \\nand consequently no food. It is complicated to take drugs without \\nhaving eaten something, and it happened to me”.\\nA 40-year-old woman in Mangunde said: “I had to abandon \\nthe treatment because when taking drugs with empty stomach I \\ncouldn’t stand, but when I got something to eat and the activists \\nvisited me, I decided to restart the treatment and now I am better \\nnourished”.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2021-11-09T10:52:25+01:00', 'moddate': '2021-11-09T10:52:26+01:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.0000000DD.pdf', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2021\\n3\\nPoverty, Illiteracy, Hunger and Nomadism as Social,  \\nCultural and Economic Reasons of Treatment Abandonment in HIV/AIDS Patients in Mozambique\\nA 49-year-old woman in Mangunde, a peasant with six chil-\\ndren who has been on treatment for eight years, abandoned in \\n2019 the treatment: “I had no food and decided by myself to stop \\ntaking drugs because I did not feel well after taking drugs with-\\nout eating something. I became sick and when the situation got \\nworse, I decided to continue treatment, but it is still very difficult \\nbecause there is no food”.\\nLaurent Magesa in Azetsop,\\n13 (2016:17) “In many areas of \\nsub-Saharan Africa, however, these medications are still beyond \\neasy reach of the majority of the poor, especially in the rural ar -\\neas”. Magesa continues arguing that “… poverty is indeed gen-\\nerally acknowledged as a major contributing factor to the spread \\nof the infection”. Also because, citing Eileen Stillwaggon who \\nargues that “HIV transmission is a predictable outcome of an \\nenvironment of poverty, worsening nutrition, chronic parasitic \\ninfection, and limited access to medical care” are all related to \\npoverty. In the same line, Stillwaggon believes that “HIV is a \\ndisease of poverty in the African context”. \\nThe reluctance of some governments to fully implement ARV \\ntreatment and a food integrated approach to support poor people \\nin treatment justifies treatment abandonment in some patients.\\nA 32-year-old patient in Mangunde said: “I had to leave Ma-\\nngunde to Beira looking for better living conditions, and there I \\ndidn’t continue taking drugs and became sick”. \\nA 44-year-old man with five children in Beira, and in treat-\\nment at Ponta-gea health centre for two years said: “I am a driver \\nand I often travel abroad, and once I went to Congo for work. I \\nstayed there for more than two months and I had no drugs during \\nthat period, but when I came back I went to the health centre but \\nthey considered me as an abandon”.\\nA 56-year-old patient at DREAM centre in Beira, in treat-\\nment for 16 years and who has four children, said: “I am a sailor \\nand as you know this work demands going to the sea for a long \\nperiod and often I don’t come to the health centre for long, but \\nwhen back home I always come to take the medicine”.\\nAnother patient at Ponta-gea health centre, sixteen years in \\ntreatment, said: “I went to Cabo Delgado for work and due to the \\nwar I stayed there for six months and I was not taking the drugs \\nduring this period. I became sick and came to Beira, but when I \\narrived at the health centre they had considered me as an abandon”.\\nMobility of people from urban to suburb areas were consid-\\nered in the past to have increased the spread of the virus. Now \\nhuman mobility, of HIV patients in particular, is becoming one \\nof the reasons of treatment abandonment.\\nA 48-year-old man in treatment at a DREAM centre, who \\nhas three children and has been in treatment for three years said: \\n“I am biscateiro (part-time worker), and we move from one side \\nto another looking for a job, and I went to Inhaminga (200 kilo-\\nmetres from Beira city) and stayed there for a long time. But got \\nsick because I was not taking drugs. Then I couldn’t manage to \\nwork and had to come back to Beira. Now I am reintegrated, I am \\ntaking drugs and I am feeling well”.\\nThe above declarations demonstrate how hunger and nomad-\\nism influence the abandoning of the treatment. There is of course \\na patient’s responsibility in adherence to treatment, however, \\nthere are structural situations which will need a wider interven-\\ntion. Cahill, edited by Azetsop, (2016:394) wrote “In Africa, the \\nbattle against AIDS must be fought on three fronts: taking indi-\\nvidual responsibility; changing cultural attitudes and established \\npractices; reducing local, continental, and global structures that \\ncause structural and other forms of injustice”. \\nLeonardo Palombi (2017) in an article about HIV in Malawi \\nconcludes that “Educated, urbanized HIV-infected adults living \\nfar from programme centres are at high risk of LTFU, particular-\\nly if there is no maternal figure in the household”. Moreover, the \\nsame study found out that also distance from the health centres \\nand costs of transportation were factors associated to the aban-\\ndonment. In Mangunde health centre, some patients reported that \\nthey must walk the whole day to reach the health centre where \\nthey receive medications. This effort needs energy to walk, in an \\narea where there are no means of transport. This is a problem that \\nmust be integrated in designing retention strategies in Africa. In \\ndeveloping countries, as Palombi states, reaching health-care cen-\\ntres is often difficult, and it becomes even more challenging for \\npatients who do not have the resources or energy to seek care. HIV \\ntreatment should consider social, economic, and structural con-\\ntexts to integrate it as part of a holistic approach. “Nevertheless, \\nthe correct and effective treatment of HIV requires a comprehen-\\nsive and multi-dimensional approach and cannot be achieved by \\nmerely distributing drugs to patients who qualify for treatment. \\nDiagnostics, strategies that assure adherence to treatment, trained \\npersonnel, mechanism for monitoring opportunistic infections and \\nconditions that manifest or co-exist with HIV infections, includ-\\ning malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases and mal-\\nnutrition, are also required” (Marazzi et al, 2005:2). Considering \\nonly drugs as an isolated solution for treating HIV in developing \\ncountries will fail. According to UNAIDS, cited by Joseph Healey \\n(2016:80), “to close the gap around access to HIV services will not \\nbe met unless the delivery of antiretroviral treatment is radically \\nreshaped into community-led approaches that adapt to the realities \\nof those living with HIV”. In Mangunde and Beira health centres, \\nwith the only exception of the DREAM centres, nutritional support \\nto HIV patients is not implemented, and this is justified with the \\ninternational crises that affect the country.\\nResults\\nOut of the 82 patients interviewed in the study, professional rea-\\nsons are the most mentioned determinants (36,6%), followed by \\nthe distance from the health centre (26,8%). Also, the trip is men-\\ntioned by 25.6% of the respondents, followed by other diseases \\n(11.0%). It is important to clarify that the two determinants, trip \\nand professional reasons, may be considered under the same cat-\\negory (nomadism) as they both describe movements of patients \\nfrom the usual place of living to another place to look for job, \\nland to cultivate, or other motivations. Long distance to the health \\ncentre comes out as a major concern too. In a resource limited \\nsetting, like in Mangunde, there are no means of transport and \\nthere are patients who have to walk more than 100 kilometres to \\nget to the health centre to receive the drugs (Table 1).\\nIn Table 2, the results of the interviews of the health profes-\\nsionals show a different scenario. Lack of food or hunger have \\nbeen identified and described as key problems (42,9%) for aban-\\ndonment, followed by low cultural level/illiteracy and nomadism. \\nIn the experience of professionals, stigma and bad quality of care \\ndo not appear significant reasons. \\nDiscussion\\nMany studies investigated the LTFU (Loss to Follow Up) phe-\\nnomenon, especially at clinical and biomedical level. However, \\ndifferent researchers were not in agreement about possible sub-\\njective or objective perspectives on the reasons (social, cultural, \\nor economic) that led patients to abandonment. \\nThe present study did not show evidence of cultural determi-\\nnants associated with abandonment. Interestingly, patients report \\nthat long distances to the health centres is an important deter -\\nminant of abandonment, representing 26.8% of the responses.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2021-11-09T10:52:25+01:00', 'moddate': '2021-11-09T10:52:26+01:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.0000000DD.pdf', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2021\\n4\\nPoverty, Illiteracy, Hunger and Nomadism as Social,  \\nCultural and Economic Reasons of Treatment Abandonment in HIV/AIDS Patients in Mozambique\\nAmong health professionals this determinant is marginal (1.4%). \\nNomadism has never been considered by professionals as a rea-\\nson for abandoning treatment, even if more than 60% of the pa-\\ntients consider it as a key reason. Such a perception mismatch \\nbetween patients and professionals is highlighted by the fact that \\na meaningful number of professionals (21.4%) does not know \\nwhy their patients abandon treatment. However, it should be \\nmentioned that more than 70% of the interviewed professionals \\nwere trained volunteers, rather than nurses or doctors. \\nOf course, there are problems and conditions that are difficult \\nto be reported in an interview, such as poverty, hunger, or stigma. \\nIn any case, the strong relationship between patients and peer edu-\\ncators or trained volunteers allowed the authors to explore hidden \\nreasons or knowledge in these fields, namely lack of food and low \\ncultural level/illiteracy. In fact, the trained volunteers who work \\ndaily with the patients, visiting them at homes and encouraging \\nthem to continue the treatment, develop a better understanding of \\nthe difficulties the patients are facing in continuing the treatment. \\nSumming up, hunger, illiteracy and nomadism are key prob-\\nlems, all directly related to poverty. Therefore, different variables \\nassociated with poverty determine the abandonment of most of \\nthe interviewed patients. Lack of money to get a transport to the \\nhealth centre, lack of money to buy food and moving from one \\nplace to another (nomadism) looking for better living conditions \\nare actually all poverty variables. The intervention of trained vol-\\nunteers plays an important role for the reintegration of the pa-\\ntients who had abandoned treatment.\\nConclusion \\nAmong the different social, cultural, and economic reasons lead-\\ning to HIV treatment abandonment, hunger, illiteracy and no-\\nmadism were reported by the studied population. \\nMozambique, a country with limited resources, in order to \\novercome the abandonment phenomenon will have to adopt a ho-\\nlistic approach in HIV/AIDS treatment strategies. Peer educators \\nand trained volunteers seem to be a key element in supporting \\npatients throughout a long lifelong treatment. This may improve \\nthe compliance of the patients and, consequently, improve the \\ncontrol of the HIV/AIDS epidemics. High level of poverty in \\nthe country, including bad heath conditions, lack of specialized \\nhealth staff, or lack of roads and means of transportation are \\nwidely seen as factors affecting the HIV/AIDS treatment poli-\\ncies. We are convinced that human resources, one richness of the \\ncountry, could be the best answer to solve at least part of the \\nproblems of compliance. \\nTreatment should be considered in a proper context. Social, \\neconomic, cultural, and anthropological features of the popula-\\ntion must be considered to promote and implement an effective \\nhealth system that can benefit all. The role of trained volunteers \\nand peer educators must be supported, so to improve adherence \\nof the patients.\\nAcknowledgment\\nWe thank the DREAM Program staff for making data available \\nand for its efforts in fighting HIV/AIDS.\\nTable 1.

Therefore, leading to a loss of resistance to acute \\nphysical, psychological and socioeconomic stressors, and even \\na diminished ability to function normally, placing the individual \\nat a steadily increasing risk of negative consequences, such as \\nhospitalizations and delirium.\\n1-3 Ferrucci and Fried were the first \\nto identify frailty as a hallmark of accelerated aging, and it is now \\nviewed as a severe outcome of the aging process.\\n4 \\nThe world’s population is aging more and more quickly: the \\npercentage of older adults will climb from 11% to an estimated \\n22% by 2050, bringing the total of older adults’ population to \\ntwo billion.\\n5 \\nGrowing scientific attention is being paid to frailty all over \\nthe world, particularly in countries with growing older adult pop-\\nulations.\\n6,7 Health care providers are focusing more on recogniz-\\ning and responding to the factors that influence older persons at \\nrisk of rapid declines in health and functionality. No agreement \\nhas been reached however in terms of operational parameters and \\nepidemiological studies employed in several settings. The result \\nis an increased risk of negative health consequences, hospitaliza-\\ntion, and greater mortality.\\n8 \\nThe first thing to do is recognize and comprehend the medical \\nassistance that older persons require, taking into consideration \\nthe contexts in which they communicate and function, to fulfil \\ntheir health requirements. In order to achieve this, specialized \\ngeriatric evaluation tools are required to detect frail older persons \\nand address their needs. The first step toward successfully im-\\nplementing public health interventions and prevention measures \\nis to identify older adults who are weak or are on the verge of \\nbecoming so.\\n9 To calculate the frailty index, a comprehensive \\ngeriatric assessment is required.10 \\nAccording to Iraq’s Ministry of Health’s annual statistical \\nreport, the percentage of the older adults’ population in Iraq \\nclimbed from 3.4% in 2010 to 5% in 2015, and will reach a pre-\\ndicted 7.2% in 2050.\\n11,12 In Northern Iraq (the Kurdistan Region), \\nthe population was calculated at 5,122,747 in 2014, and 4% was \\n65 or older, a similar pattern can be seen.\\n13\\nNevertheless, health care for older persons in Iraq is poorly \\nintegrated into the health system due to a lack of Rehabilitation \\ncentres for older adults, a shortage of locally trained geriatric \\nphysicians or nurses, and a small number of practitioners who are \\nnot prepared to fully deal with such a rapid increase in the aging \\npopulation.\\n14 Because of the dearth of local geriatric postgradu-\\nate students, there are few geriatric physicians in the Kurdistan \\nRegion, according to our understanding of the local situation. \\nThere is a general shortage in the region’s healthcare system of \\ngeriatric programs, rehabilitation centres for older persons, and \\na system able to gather accurate information on prevalent health \\nconditions among the older adults and respond to their needs.\\n15 \\nIn terms of social connections, there are no specific designated \\nareas for older persons to gather for social activities apart from \\ntraditional ones, including family visits, gathering in mosques or \\npublic café.\\n16 Their social needs are unknown, due to a lack of \\ncomprehensive research about older adult citizens in the region.\\nFurthermore, few studies, offering sporadic data, have been \\nundertaken in this context; the majority of them include older \\npersons living in care homes, which are not representing the sta-\\ntus of the majority of Iraq’s older adult population. According to \\na study conducted in Erbil in 2013, the majority of those living \\nin nursing homes were aged between 61 and 80 (71.4%).\\n17 The \\ninvestigation in the rural area found that impairment increases \\nwith age, with a peak in mental and physical impairment (18.5%) \\nfor those aged 65 and over. Impairments are more common in \\nlow-income families than rich families, and less wealthy parents \\nare much more likely to be found in rural areas than in metropol-\\nitan areas (41% vs. 36%).\\n13\\nThe main aim of this study was thus to investigate a still un-\\nknown topic, i.e., physical frailty among older persons living in \\ntheir homes in Northern Iraq (Kurdistan Region), to determine \\nthe barriers to healthcare services in the urban and rural areas \\n(Directorate of Sulaymaniyah).\\nMethodology\\nPopulation and setting\\nThis cross-sectional research was carried out from July 2020 to \\nMarch 2021, through structured interviews. Involving a sample \\nof (200) older persons (≥ 65 years old) living in their homes ran-\\ndomly selected in two different areas, one urban (Sulaymaniyah \\ncity-center) and one rural (Penjwen district), in the Kurdistan \\nRegion of Iraq were considered. Older adults living in nursing \\nhomes or hospitalized were not considered at this stage, as this \\nwas not the purpose of the research.

Participants \\nwere free to participate or not in the interview and answered in-\\ndependently or with the support of relatives. The study sample \\nwas collected from people’s homes. When direct face-to-face \\ninterviews were not possible – mainly due to the Covid-19 pan-\\ndemic,\\n18 phone contact was made, obtaining the relative contact \\ndetails from friends and health centres. Those who refuse to par-\\nticipate or only answered half of the questionnaire were removed \\nfrom the total sample. \\nThe Questionnaire\\nTwo existing validated tools were used to create an ad hoc ques-\\ntionnaire: \\n1.  The short functional geriatric evaluation questionnaire \\n(SFGE) was used to predict bad life outcomes among older \\npersons. It has ten ordinal variables (age, gender, education, \\nco-habitants, help if needed, involvement in social activities, \\nreceiving regular social assistance from NGOs, Govern-\\nment, or other people not living with the person, economic \\ncondition, energy and drive, health and functional status). A \\n34-point range, from -6 to +27 could be obtained, so that the \\nperson could be classified in one of the following four class-\\nes: robust (score ≤0), pre-frail (score 1-2), frail (score 3-9), \\nand very frail (score ≥10).\\n9 We made some alterations to the \\nSFGE; for living arrangements, we added “living with chil-\\ndren and other relatives”, and for receiving formal social as-\\nsistance we altered to receiving formal social assistance from \\nGovernment, NGO, or other people not living with them. For \\nthe financial situation we included the option “no work in-\\ncome/no State pension (score 0), “State pension (score -1)”, \\n“still working (score 2)”. Regarding the economic condition \\nif the older person could not get to the end of the month on \\ntheir pension/pocket money or income, we identified as the \\nmain area for economic concern “buying food, medicine, and \\nclothes and paying bills”, and “paying someone to do daily \\nliving or household tasks”. These alterations were made in \\norder that the questionnaire becomes more suitable with the \\nsituation of the older adults in the region.\\n2.  The barriers to health care services questionnaire were used \\nto investigate the challenges faced in accessing health care \\nservices. It contains nine assertions about obstacles to health \\ncare access for older adults who are likely to have a stroke \\n(work responsibility, caring for others, regular doctors or \\nnone responsive to concern, fear of unneeded tests, serious \\nillness or safety on street, transport and medical bills). Indi-\\nviduals could use a 3-point scale (no, moderately and very \\nmuch) to respond.\\n19\\n Questionnaires were translated into Kurdish language to facil-\\nitate understanding. Participants’ privacy was anonymized by \\nassigning ID numbers to questionnaires like (Sulaymaniyah \\nnumber 1, Penjwen Number 1, etc.), therefore not including \\nidentification data. The questionnaire data were later inserted \\nand stored in Excel sheets. \\n The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the \\nCollege of Administration and Economics, Department of \\nStatistics and Informatics, University of Sulaymaniyah (75/1 \\non 05.04.2021) \\nStatistical Analysis\\nThe descriptive analysis included frequencies and percentag-\\nes. Data were reported as an overall sample and then split be-\\ntween Sulaymaniyah and Penjewen. Data were analysed using \\nthe Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 22). \\nThe Pearson’s chi-square and Bonferroni correction tests were \\nused to assess the differences between categorical variables. All \\np values were two-tailed, and p≤0.05 was considered statistically \\nsignificant.\\nResults\\nThe total sample included 200 older persons: 160 from Sulay-\\nmaniyah (80%), 40 from Penjwen (20%). The median age was 71 \\nyears, with 42.5% (85 persons) aged <70 years old, 39.0% (n. 78) \\naged 70-80 years old, 18.5% (n. 37) aged >80 years old, 52.0% \\n(n. 104) were male. When considering the two areas separately \\n(i.e., Sulaymaniyah vs. Penjwen), 52.5% (n. 84) of participants \\nfrom the urban area were male vs. 50.0% (n. 20) in the rural area. \\nThe median age was 71 (43.1% aged <70, 39.4% aged 70-80, \\n17.5% aged >80 and 74.5 (40.0%) aged <70, 37.5% aged 70-80 \\nand 22.5% aged >80 respectively). \\nIn terms of education, 73% of the sample was illiterate (68.1% \\nin Sulaymaniyah vs 92.5% in Penjwen), while only 4% (all from \\nthe urban area) had higher educational qualifications. Less than \\na quarter had attended elementary or secondary schools (26.9% \\nvs. 7.5% respectively). \\nTable 1 presents some variables included in the SFGE, with \\nresults presented as a total then split by area of provenience. In \\nthe co-habitant item, 56.5% (n. 113) of older persons were liv-\\ning with a spouse (43.5% in Sulaymaniyah vs. 65% in Penjwen). \\nMost of the older adult population received informal help when \\nneeded (83.1% vs. 72.5%) in the urban and rural areas respec-\\ntively. Most of the older adult population (66.5%, n. 133) did not \\ntake part in any social activity (69.4% Sulaymaniyah vs. 55% \\nPenjwen). Additionally, most of them (90.5%, n. 181) did not \\nreceive any formal social assistance from NGOs, Government, or \\nother parties (90.6% Sulaymaniyah vs. 90% Penjwen). \\nTable 1: The SFGE evaluation questionnaire - Parameters: \\nliving conditions.\\nWhen considering financial support, nearly half of the sample \\n(51.5%, 48.1% Sulaymaniyah vs. 65% Penjwen) did not have \\nany work income or State pension, most were from the urban \\narea. Half of the investigated population (49.50%, 79% Sulay-\\nmaniyah vs. 20% Penjwen) was concerned about not having \\nenough income for their needs until the end of the month. This \\nwas reported to be due to most of the money being spent on \\nnecessities (97.5% Sulaymaniyah vs. 100% Penjwen), such as \\nfood, medicine, clothes, and bills.

According to annual figures from the Ministry of \\nHealth in Iraq, the percentage of older persons aged 60 and over \\nclimbed from 3.4% in 2010 to 5% in 2015, and is expected to \\nreach 7.2% in 2025.\\n22 However, there is still a dearth of health \\ndata on older adults Iraqi citizens. 23 We conducted a pilot study \\nin Iraq’s Northern Region to evaluate the incidence of physical \\nfrailty and the barriers to access healthcare services in the coun-\\ntry (Kurdish Region - Directorate of Sulaymaniyah). The effects \\nof the setting on the situations of older individuals living in their \\nhomes were explored in both the urban and rural locations. This \\nresearch was the first of its kind in this area. It appears that no \\nprevious studies have mea sured the frailty of older persons, even \\nin urban areas of Kurdistan. \\nThere was a statistically significant relationship between \\nfrailty and the 70-80 age group for the “very frail” score in urban \\nvs. rural areas, particularly in the urban region, disagreeing with \\nresearch data on Erbil\\n24,25 and data from Jordan,26 which reported \\nthat frailty increased in the 65-70 age group. Unlike the results \\nfrom this study, the previous study showed that the prevalence of \\nfrailty increased in persons over the age of 65 in a rural area of \\nTurkey.\\n27 \\nThere was a statistically significant relationship between \\nfrailty and female gender in Sulaymaniyah vs. Penjwen, partic-\\nularly in the urban area, in agreement with findings from China, \\nJapan, and southern Italy, reporting that frailest older persons \\nwere women,\\n28,29 since on average women live longer than men, \\nyet their health is worse.30 \\nIlliterate individuals had the highest frailty scores, which rose \\nin rural areas. Our findings regarding illiteracy and older adults’ \\nfrailty are corroborated by the study which concluded that the \\nmajority of frail older persons did not receive any formal edu-\\ncation (52%).\\n24 Additionally, our data concerning frailty among \\nrural older persons tallied with previous data reported in the ru-\\nral area of Turkey. The percentage of participants with less than \\nthree years of schooling was 84.3%, and it was seen that less-ed-\\nucated older persons were more vulnerable to the risk of frailty.\\n27 \\nIn most cases, intergenerational support flowed in both di-\\nrections.31 Families, particularly adult children, were the primary \\nsource of support and care for their older adults’ relatives, but \\nolder persons themselves frequently cared for their relatives.\\n31 \\nIn our study we found that the majority of older persons were \\nliving with a spouse in Sulaymaniyah and Penjwen, the numbers \\nwere higher in the urban area. Moreover, most of them received \\ninformal help when they needed support, with a large number of \\nparticipants never having received any formal social assistance, \\neither in the urban or in the rural area. This finding is in line with \\nthe results of a previous study,\\n32 according to study, physically \\nchallenged older persons are more prone to feelings of loneliness \\nand isolation, which can lead to health problems, diminished \\nfunctioning, and mental health complications, including depres-\\nsion.\\n33 \\nA large number of older persons in our study did not have \\nany work income or public pension in both areas, with frailty \\nscores being higher in the rural area. Half of the study popula-\\ntion in Sulaymaniyah and Penjwen, especially in the urban area, \\nwere concerned about not having enough income to get by until \\nthe end of the month, because most of the money was spent on \\nnecessities and paying bills, with frailty scores being higher in \\nSulaymaniyah. The situation becomes worse when older adults \\nneed medications for chronic diseases, as reported by Faiq et al., \\nwho revealed that 75.5% of Kurdish older adults needed extra \\nmoney to care for their health.\\n34 The lack of a health information \\nsystem that might routinely collect information on older adults \\nand identify relative needs has a significant impact on increasing \\nfrailty among the older persons in Region.\\n35 \\nAccording to our findings, rising frailty in Penjwen is asso-\\nciated with a lack of healthcare for rural residents. One proba-\\nble explanation is that urban communities have better access to \\nphysical activity than rural communities.\\n36 Rural older people’s \\npoor health is directly related to their low socioeconomic level, \\nwith a higher poverty rate and poorer health, meaning they have \\na greater need for services and resources than older people in \\nurban regions.\\n37 \\nThe results of our study showed that more than a quarter of \\nthe older persons in the Penjwen area do not have regular ac-\\ncess to doctors’ care, which plays an important role in increasing \\nfrailty. As a result, access to healthcare services is a major con-\\ncern, particularly for the rural population, since older adults have \\nmany more health problems and chronic diseases, necessitating \\nmore medical attention than the general population.\\n38 Since only \\nprimary healthcare institutions exist in Kurdistan, persons resid-\\ning in rural areas may only have access to junior doctors, who \\nare not experts in the area of geriatrics. Furthermore, the quality \\nof care is significantly inferior to that in urban regions due to a \\nlack or scarcity of resources (such as doctors, medical personnel, \\nlaboratory testing, radiographic imaging, and drugs). Patients \\nmust travel a considerable distance to reach better healthcare \\nfacilities in Kurdistan’s tertiary centres, which are only located \\nin the country’s largest cities if their health needs are not met \\nwhere they live.\\n39 As a consequence, integrating the urban and \\nrural healthcare systems is a crucial step towards narrowing the \\ngap in health care access between the two locations.\\n40 \\nAlmost half of the population in the Penjwen area had great \\ntransport difficulties, with a highly significant difference com-\\npared with the other region. A previous study demonstrated a \\nrelationship between frailty, healthcare constraints, and transpor-\\ntation, and is considered to be one of the most serious concerns \\nfor the growing older adults’ population in rural areas.\\n41,42 Since \\npersonal satisfaction is a crucial component of wellbeing for the \\nolder adults’ population, there is a link between a lack of mobil-\\nity and a low level of life satisfaction, isolation, loneliness, and \\nself-reported bad health, especially in rural areas.\\n43\\nAdditionally, older persons in the rural area came up against \\nthe barrier of medical bills to a high degree, with a highly sig-\\nnificant difference compared with the urban area. Since out-of-\\npocket payments are the major source of financial stress for rural \\nresidents, cost concerns among older adults are mostly linked \\nto supplemental insurance coverage. Cost, accessibility, lack of \\ninformation, and caring for others are all obstacles to receiving \\nhealthcare, according to other studies.\\n44 \\nStudy limitations: \\n–  Due to the lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic only 200 \\nsamples of older adults were taken.\\n–  Some older adults refused to participate and some of them \\njust answered half of the questionnaire, so those samples \\nwere deleted from the total sample.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-13T14:34:00+03:00', 'moddate': '2022-06-13T14:34:01+03:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.0000000E7.pdf', 'total_pages': 8, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2022\\n7\\nPhysical Frailty and Barriers to Healthcare Access Among Older Adults \\nin Urban and Rural Areas/ Kurdistan Region of Iraq\\n1.

Gastrectomy \\nwith D2 lymphadenectomy is considered the standard surgical \\napproach for locally advanced GC. The surgical options of ga-\\nstric cancer are followed by reconstruction techniques achieving \\noptimal resection margins, pathologic staging, and harvesting an \\nadequate number of lymph nodes, significantly influence patient \\npostoperative functional status. Despite notable improvements in \\nsurgical approaches for gastric cancer over recent decades, the \\nmortality rate associated with this disease remains elevated.\\nThe purpose of this study is to describe our surgery experien-\\nce for GC.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThis retrospective analysis was performed on a total of 80 pa-\\ntients that underwent surgical procedures for gastric cancer (GC) \\nat the First Service of General Surgery, UHC “Mother Theresa” \\nin Tirana, Albania between January and December 2019.\\nThe analysis includes demographical characteristics, tumor \\nstaging, and surgical procedures performed, with a particular fo-\\ncus on patients treated with curative surgical intent. The informa-\\ntion was deducted from the clinical file of patients.\\nPreoperative staging procedures included abdominal and pel-\\nvic computed tomography, upper digestive endoscopy, and labo-\\nratory tests. \\nPatients involved in the study were those who had previously \\nundergone diagnostic or endoscopic procedures and subsequent-\\nly proceeded to resection. The type of gastric resection (total or \\nsubtotal) was based on the tumor’s location, aiming to achieve a \\ntumor-free proximal margin (R0).\\nStaging was based on the Eighth Edition of the TNM system \\nby the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for Interna-\\ntional Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC).\\n3\\nThe surgical approach and the extent of lymphadenectomy \\nadhered to the guidelines recommended by the Japanese Gastric \\nCancer Association 6\\nth Edition.4\\nPatients with tumors originating outside the stomach or tho-\\nse undergoing gastric surgical procedures for benign conditions, \\nsuch as peptic ulcers or gastrostomy for other reasons were \\nexcluded from this study.\\nResults \\nDemographical results are presented in Table 1.

Total gastrectomy \\nwas prevalent in tumors of the stomach’s body, while subtotal \\nresection was performed in the antrum-pyloric region and polar \\nsuperior for cardia region in selected patients.\\nLymphadenectomy is now considered standard for treating \\ngastric cancer and is recommended in various national guidelines \\nfor patients with advanced gastric cancer.\\n9 A Cochrane systema-\\ntic review found that D2 lymphadenectomy led to significantly \\nbetter disease-specific survival compared to D1 lymphadenec-\\ntomy, despite a higher mortality rate in the D2 group. However, \\nno significant difference was observed in the disease-free inter -\\nval between the two groups. The Japan Clinical Oncology Group \\n(JCOG) trial 9501 revealed that D3 lymphadenectomy, which \\nincludes para-aortic lymph node dissection, resulted in higher \\nmorbidity rates but did not significantly improve overall 5-year \\nsurvival or local recurrence compared to D2 lymphadenectomy. \\nAnalysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results \\n(SEER) database suggests that removing more than 15 lymph \\nnodes during gastrectomy for gastric cancer can improve survi-\\nval.\\n12,13,14,15\\nThe mean number of lymph nodes harvested in this study \\nwas 15 which follows the NCCN guidelines that recommend \\nD2 lymphadenectomy or a minimum recovery of 15 lymph no-\\ndes for safety and an average of 29 retrieved lymph nodes for \\nadequacy.\\n10\\nThe debate over extended resection (D2 resection with sple-\\nnectomy and distal pancreatectomy) for advanced gastric can-\\ncer, initially performed by Japanese surgeons, has persisted for \\ndecades. While early reports suggested improved survival, large \\nprospective randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a \\nsignificant survival benefit. Patients undergoing splenectomy and \\ndistal pancreatectomy experienced higher morbidity, mortality, \\nand longer hospital stays. In a study by Otsuji et al., out of 128 \\npatients undergoing total gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcino-\\nma, pancreatosplenectomy (PS) and splenectomy (S) were asso-\\nciated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, primarily due to \\npancreatic fistula occurrence.\\n16,17,18,19\\nConclusions\\nDespite a decrease in gastric cancer incidence across Europe in \\nthe past few decades, it remains a relatively common tumor in \\nAlbania. \\nIn the present study, we reported a broad view of GC surgical \\ntreatment in the Service of First Clinic in Mother Teresa Hospital. \\nAt present, the primary curative treatment for gastric cancer \\nis surgical resection, in advanced gastric cancer preoperatory ne-\\noadjuvant chemotherapy is indicated. \\nThis study provides an indicator of the importance of a pro-\\nper staging of gastric cancer following the AJCC Staging Sy-\\nstem which is one of the main factors determining the treatment \\ntype.\\nThe study suggests that gastric surgery with D2 lymphade-\\nnectomy could be effectively performed in patients with defined \\ntumor margins and with low operative risk. The positivity to di-\\nstant metastases could lead to inoperable cases that terminate \\nwith exploratory laparotomy or nutritional jejunostomy.\\nTable 4.

Conva-\\nlescent plasma is a source of antiviral neutralizing antibodies. In \\nthe pre-vaccine era, convalescent plasma was used to treat viral \\ndiseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and influenza, \\nand, more recently, influenza, Ebola virus disease, and severe \\nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus epidemics, with varying \\ndegrees of success.\\n6-8 Based on the experience of treating these \\nviral infectious diseases, it might be worthwhile to test the safety \\nand efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-\\n2-infected patients.\\n20-23 Although the use of convalescent plasma \\nshows promise, the evidence supporting its use in the treatment of \\nCOVID-19 remains limited. In fact, available information stands \\non anecdotal cases, experience based on limited hospital data and \\nfew relatively small, randomized trials conducted after the 2019 \\ncoronavirus outbreak.\\n9 We hypothesized that pooling the suitable \\nstudies in a meta-analysis might provide more solid information \\non the efficacy of this treatment and/or at least provide data that \\nwill be useful to better frame future studies. \\nMethods\\nWe searched the literature for studies about the use of conva-\\nlescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia using the search terms \\nconvalescent plasma or hyperimmune serum, COVID-19 pneu-\\nmonia or SARS-CoV-2. We searched in two large databases, \\nPubMed and Cochrane library for articles published from Jan-\\nuary to December 2020 and that met some predefined quality \\ncriteria that could be eligible for a meta-analysis following the \\nCochrane Methodology. We found 1255 trials in the Cochrane li-\\nbrary and 401 on PubMed. After the title and abstract reading, we \\nfound 42 studies related to our criteria. After the final assessment \\nof the articles, 6 of them were chosen as final studies to be includ-\\ned in the meta-analyses. We worked using a standardized sheet to \\nextract information on the first author, year of publication, coun-\\ntry of the study group, retrospective or prospective design, sam-\\nple size, primary and secondary outcomes, adverse events, other \\nmedical conditions and medications for the plasma group and the \\ncontrol.

Al-\\nthough we may consider that this result avoids publication bias. \\nWe constructed a Funnel plot (Figure 3) to assess the asymmetry \\nof the studies, which is an indicator of publication bias. In the \\nFunnel plot, it seems to have a symmetric distribution of the stud-\\nies, but it should be evaluated by statistics test. We used Egger’s \\ntest to assess the asymmetry, (P = 0,022), it is an indicator of bias.\\nThe secondary outcome is the need for invasive ventilation. \\nIn this case we did the assessment of heterogeneity using the Test \\nof Residual Heterogeneity (P < 0.100), which indicates that there \\nis heterogeneity among studies. Therefore, the method used for \\nthe evaluation of the effect of plasma in invasive ventilation is the \\nRestricted ML, a random effect model. The results of the effect \\nof convalescent plasma on the need of invasive ventilation are \\nshown in the Forest plot (Figure 2), (P = 0.171, intercept -1.098, \\nCI [-2,669- 0,472]. Even though we have e result in favour of \\nconvalescent plasma in lowering the need of invasive ventilation, \\nit is not significant (P = 0,171). We constructed a Funnel plot to \\nassess the asymmetry (Figure 4) and also used the Egger’s test to \\nsee if it is statistically significant P = 0.274. In this case it means \\nthat there is an asymmetry and an indicator of no publication \\nbias.\\nDiscussion\\nThe studies we included in the meta-analyses had different dis-\\nease severity patients, from moderate to severe and life-threaten-\\ning disease. This could have affected the result about the efficacy \\nof convalescent plasma in COVID-19 and the overall result is \\nweak in favour of convalescent plasma. This kind of result could \\nhave many reasons like the different kind of populations in the \\nstudies in terms of severity (from moderate to life threatening \\ndisease) and their different response to the treatment, the time \\nof initiation of the treatment, the number of the participants. All \\nthe studies reported very few adverse events with the transfusion \\nof convalescent plasma which makes plasma a safe therapeutic \\nstrategy. A review about convalescent plasma therapy reported \\nthat convalescent plasma treatment appeared effective and safe \\nfor COVID-19, but there was a need for randomized studies to \\nfurther evaluate its efficacy and safety.\\n9 Another systematic re-\\nview and meta-analyses reported that convalescent plasma thera-\\npy appears safe for COVID-19, and plasma treated patients have \\nmarked reductions in their serum viral loads and most are virus \\nnegative after transfusion.\\n10 Patients with severe COVID-19 ben-\\nefit more from the convalescent plasma transfusion than critical \\npatients,\\n11 and patients treated in early stage are more likely to \\nsurvive. Another study suggests that convalescent plasma use in \\nsevere and critically ill patients with COVID-19 may improve \\nsurvival if given early in the course of disease.\\n12 A lot of different \\nagents have been studied since the outbreak of the pandemics. \\nMany studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of clo-\\nrochine, hydroxiclorochine, azythromycine, different antiviral \\nagents and corticosteroids.\\n26 Most of these medications are prov-\\nen to have no effect on COVID-19 infection. 13 The only agents \\nproven in some randomized studies to have beneficial results are \\nRemdesivir in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cortico-\\nsteroids in those who require oxygen supplementation.\\n3-5 Another \\nagent, Ivermectin, has been studied initially in vitro, with good \\nresults on inhibiting the viral replication.\\n14 A recent study pub-\\nlished in January 2021 reported that among patients with non-se-\\nvere COVID-19 and no risk factors for severe disease, receiving \\na single 400 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin within 72 hours of fe-\\nver or cough onset resulted in no difference in the proportion of \\nPCR-positive cases.\\n15 The convalescent plasma was used earlier \\nin the treatment of other infectious diseases and studying its ef-\\nficacy in COVID-19 is reasonable.\\n16-19 In summary, in our me-\\nta-analyses, convalescent plasma doesn’t have a significant effect \\nfor reducing the mortality and the need for invasive ventilation \\nbut considering it as a safe treatment, it can be worthy to continue \\nstudying its efficacy in larger studies, in order to get more solid \\nand convincing results.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-07-05T17:43:05+03:00', 'moddate': '2024-07-05T17:43:07+03:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.0000000FD.pdf', 'total_pages': 7, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2024\\n4\\nA Meta-analysis of the Effect of Convalescent Plasma  \\nover Standard Treatment in Covid-19 Pneumonia\\nTable 1.

The onset and evolution of \\nsuch epidemics is facilitated by the fact that many VPDs spread \\nrapidly within closed contexts and can manifest themselves \\nwith atypical symptoms, so they are often not suspected early. \\nCompared to children, adults tend to have a more severe clini-\\ncal course and more complications more often when affected by \\ndifferent VPDs (for example, measles, chickenpox). Vaccination \\nof healthcare workers is justified to directly protect themselves \\nand indirectly protect patients\\n4 however, inadequate coverage of \\nhealthcare workers against VPDs is a global problem.5,6 Accord-\\ning to the ECDC, hospital workers are 13 times more at risk than \\nthe general population.\\n7 \\nMeasles is an acute, highly infectious disease that is trans -\\nmitted through airborne respiratory droplets or by direct contact \\nwith the nasal secretions of infected individuals. Two doses of the \\nvaccine achieve 97% efficacy in preventing measles, while one \\ndose is 93% effective. Therefore, the World Health Organization \\n(WHO) recommends two doses and coverage of at least 95% to \\nensure herd immunity to prevent epidemics and to provide indi\\n-\\nrect protection to unvaccinated individuals.8 In recent years, there \\nhas been a drastic decline in measles vaccination coverage in Eu-\\nrope, probably responsible for several epidemic peaks.9 The aver-\\nage coverage of measles vaccinations in Europe reaches just 91% \\nand only six countries (Croatia, Hungary, Iceland, Portugal, Slo\\n-\\nvakia, and Sweden) report coverage of the two doses of measles \\nvaccine at or above 95%.\\n10 In Italy, in 2013, vaccination coverage \\nin children at 24 months exceeded 90%, while in 2016 it was sig-\\nnificantly reduced, reaching 87%. In 2017, Italy recorded one of \\nthe highest measles infection rates.\\n10 According to WHO, measles \\ncases in Europe increased fourfold in 2017, affecting more than \\n21,000 people and causing 35 victims. They were mainly detected \\nin Romania (5608 cases), Italy (5098 cases), Greece (967 cases) \\nand Germany (929 cases).\\n11\\nThis worrying situation led to the entry into force of the leg -\\nislative decree on mandatory vaccination in June 2017. In 2018, \\nvaccination coverage was achieved with the first dose, recom\\n-\\nmended at 24 months through the tetravalent MPRV vaccine \\n(measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox), by 93.22% and for the \\nsecond dose, recommended after 5 years, by 89.20%. The trend is \\nworsening: coverage for the first dose of measles vaccine in 2020 \\nwas 91, 79%, highlighting a decrease of 2.7% compared to the \\nprevious year.\\nIn the first two months of 2019, 34,300 measles cases were \\nreported in 42 countries in the WHO European Region, including \\n13 measles-related deaths, in three countries (Albania, Romania \\nand Ukraine). Most cases have been reported in Ukraine, with \\nover 25,000 cases (>70%). As of 28 March 2019, the WHO Eu\\n-\\nropean Region reported a total of 83,540 measles cases and 74 \\nrelated deaths for 2018. This compares to 25,869 cases and 42 \\ndeaths in 2017 and 5,273 cases and 13 deaths in 2016.\\n12 During \\n2020, measles cases decreased in all EU countries (6252 cases) \\nthanks to social distancing, isolation and other preventive mea\\n-\\nsures taken for COVID-19, but in 2021 cases have increased again \\nand over 21,000 cases were reported.\\n13 Between March 2022 and \\nFebruary 2023, WHO updated measles cases (1861). Among \\nthese, 1728 (93%) were found mainly in ten countries: Tajikistan \\n(610 cases), Turkey (466 cases), Russian Federation (414 cases), \\nUnited Kingdom (67 cases), Serbia (40 cases), Austria (33 cases), \\nKyrgyzstan (29 cases), Poland (28 cases), France (22 cases) and \\nBelgium (19 cases).\\n14 During the 2017-2018 measles epidemic \\nin Europe, healthcare-associated transmission accounted for a \\nsignificant portion of the measles-associated burden. Healthcare \\nworkers have also been disproportionately affected, accounting \\nfor up to 7 and 4.2 percent of notified cases in Italy and Greece, \\nrespectively. In this context, increasing attention has been paid to \\nHCWs: compared to the general population, HCWs are estimated \\nto be at greater risk of contracting VPDs such as measles, expos\\n-\\ning both colleagues and patients.15 \\nIn particular, this study has two purposes: first, we wanted \\nto investigate the serological coverage among future healthcare \\nworkers and quantify the problem based on nationality. Second, \\nwe wanted to identify the vaccination rate epidemiologically.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nIn March 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate \\nthe vaccination coverage and immunological status of medical \\nstudents of the Catholic University “Our Lady of Good Counsel” \\nof Tirana (Albania) who were carrying out their internship at the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-10-02T13:15:14+03:00', 'moddate': '2024-10-02T13:15:15+03:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data\\\\biomedicine-prevention.000000102.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='©Biomedicine & Prevention 2024\\n2\\nSerological Evaluation for Measles, Rubella, Mumps  \\namong Albanian and Italian Medical Students Enrolled in a University in Tirana\\nPolyclinic of the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy). Medical \\nstudents were either from Albania or Italy. Socio-demographic \\ncharacteristics (gender, age, country of origin) were collected. \\nSerological data was obtained from blood tests: study partic -\\nipants underwent venepuncture of the cephalic vein, median cu -\\nbital vein, or basilic vein to obtain blood for routine blood tests. \\nA 10 ml blood sample was collected and delivered to the labora\\n-\\ntory to detect measles-specific IgG antibodies. A semi-quantita -\\ntive evaluation of specific IgG antibodies was obtained with the \\nAlifax VIRCLIA® KIT VIR VCM054 Measles IgG test, which \\nuses chemiluminescence immunoassay technology (CLIA) with \\nsensitivity and specificity values of 98% and 100% respectively. \\nSerum IgG values were expressed as a signal-to-cut-off ratio (S/\\nCO); values above 1.0 S/CO were considered protective based \\non actual testing. Antibody titers were tested for three contagious \\ndiseases to understand the immune status of the students: Rubella, \\nMeasles, and Mumps.\\nThe ethical committee for research in Human Subjects of the \\nHospital approved the study (approval n.133/21).\\nAll results were entered in a Microsoft Excel worksheet, and \\nthen analysed using SPSS version 25.0. Pearson’s correlation test \\nwas used to measure the association between continuous vari-\\nables. A p-value < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. \\nSubsequently, the variables under study were evaluated with \\nregression analysis, using the immune status (measles, mumps, \\nrubella and chickenpox) for each disease as the independent vari-\\nable and socio-demographic information (gender, age, nationali-\\nty) as the dependent variables. The odds ratio was calculated be-\\ntween the serology results for measles and nationality (Italians/\\nAlbanians). \\nResults\\nIn total, 137 medical students enrolled in the 2017/2018 and \\n2018/2019 academic years took part in the survey (27 males and \\n110 females). Among them, 27 (19%) were Italians and 110 were \\nAlbanians (81%). The mean age was 24.5 years ± 2 SD. (range: \\n22-37 years). \\nWhen testing antibody titers for Rubella, Measles, Mumps, \\nmissing data for a total of 3 students were excluded from the \\ndatabase. Specifically, the detected antibody titers were:\\n– For rubella 81% (n.110) \\n– For mumps 77% (n.105)\\n– For measles 37% (n. 51).\\nAmong the diseases with the lowest protection, measles was \\nidentified as the most problematic, with only the 37% of the total \\n(n.51 students) being protected. \\nThe sample was stratified by nationality to understand the \\ndifferences between the two nationality groups, based on a dif-\\nferent vaccination policy between Italy and Albania. The analysis \\nshowed that in the Italian group 24 students out of a total of 27 \\n(89%) were protected against Rubella, while in Albanian group \\n87 students out of a total of 111 (78%). Therefore, the number \\nof Albanian individuals unprotected for rubella among Albanians \\nwas quite high (21%; n.23 individuals). For mumps, the data \\nindicates that the percentage of students with a protective anti-\\nbody level was almost the same in both the two groups, 74% and \\n77% respectively. Protection against measles was not satisfac-\\ntory among the two groups: the protective antibody titer among \\nAlbanians was only 29%, which means that the 71% was not \\nimmunized. As for Italian students, immunization reached 67%, \\nwhile 33% resulted unprotected: a significant difference emerged \\nbetween the two nationality groups (p<0.01).\\nThe relationship between nationality and immune status against \\nmeasles was confirmed by the odd ratio: the risk of being unpro-\\ntected at the start of the internship for medical students was almost \\nfive times higher in Albanian individuals (OR: 4.6; IC: 1.9-11.4). \\nDiscussion\\nRecent reviews of EU immunization policies for HCWs have \\nhighlighted significant differences between countries in terms of \\nrecommended schedules, mode of implementation (mandatory \\nor recommended), target groups and healthcare context.\\n16 These \\nheterogeneous policies significantly influence the immunization \\nrate in all countries and could imply different risks of spreading \\nthe disease from HCWs. In previously published studies, low im-\\nmunization rates for some important VPDs have been reported \\namong European healthcare workers, including those employed \\nin high-risk settings.\\n17-21 Albanian students showed a lower rate \\nof serological protection for measles than their Italian colleagues. \\nThis low level of protection among Albanian students was also \\nconfirmed in another study, where the immunization rate was \\nonly 44%.\\n22 In Albania, although a large number of vaccinations \\nare compulsory in childhood and must be carried out in health \\nfacilities, recent studies have revealed a strong concern for the \\nTable 1.

This time-lapse can take up to a year or longer. This is \\nbecause temperatures that are too high or too low can cause the \\nvaccine to lose its potency. Once a vaccine loses its potency, it \\ncannot be recovered or regained. In some inland areas in Alba-\\nnia, there has been some concern regarding the vaccine cooling \\nsystem in the past, problems have been reported with the cooling \\nequipment and temperatures of vaccines that had not been stored \\nproperly. The investment in the cold chain equipment, used for \\nvaccine storage, recently benefited due to the latest COVID pan-\\ndemic, presumably showing a threat in the cold chain before the \\nlast recent years. With funding from UNICEF, WHO has recent-\\nly installed three new cold storage facilities to strengthen cold \\nchain capacity in some areas of Albania.\\n24 In 2018-2019, a large \\nmeasles epidemic occurred, with nearly 1,700 cases reported, \\nhighlighting the difficulty of maintaining optimal vaccination \\ncoverage all over the country.\\n25,26 \\nIn the present study, the immunization rate of subjects was less \\nthan 70%, raising concerns regarding the risk of nosocomial mea-\\nsles infection for these workers.\\n27-29 The effectiveness of the MMR \\n(measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine may vary depending on the \\nspecific strain of circulating viruses. Variations in strains can af-\\nfect the vaccine’s ability to offer complete protection against these \\ndiseases. For example, the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, con-\\ntaining the Jeryl Lynn strain, for the prevention of mumps is 72% \\nwith a single dose and 86% with two doses. Therefore, it is import-\\nant that vaccines are formulated to cover the most common viral \\nstrains circulating in a given geographic region in order to maxi-\\nmize the effectiveness of vaccination. In Italy, there is no manda-\\ntory national measles vaccination policy for medical students and \\nhealthcare workers, except in two Italian regions, and non-immune \\npeople are sometimes offered vaccination in the workplace, but \\nmore often they are referred to a public service immunization pro-\\ngram, resulting in a delay or failure to administer the vaccine. In \\nAlbania there is no vaccination policy for medical students as well. \\nIn a previous study, direct vaccine administration was shown to \\nbe more effective and cheaper than other strategies.\\n30 Maintain-\\ning routine coverage of at least 95% will stop transmission of the \\nvirus, so raising awareness among stakeholders and HCWs of the \\nrisk of the disease is crucial. The elimination of this pathology is \\npossible thanks to the presence of vaccines which, however, must \\nbe administered adequately. It is estimated that 95% of the popu-\\nlation needs to be vaccinated with two doses of measles vaccine to \\nachieve protection of the entire population and prevent outbreaks. \\nGiven the inadequate vaccination coverage in Italy and Albania \\nand the circulation of the measles virus, we recommend vaccina-\\ntion in childhood according to the vaccination calendar, serological \\nevaluation and possible vaccination for HCWs who do not declare \\nthis type of vaccination or do not have protective antibody titers.\\n31 \\nThis strategy has been found in previous studies to be highly effec-\\ntive from a cost and savings point of view.\\n32 Our study shows that \\n18 women are not protected from rubella. This information is con-\\ncerning and indicates a potential risk of disease for these female \\nstudents in case of future pregnancy. \\nThis work has many possible limitations. First, the circum-\\nstances of vaccination (type of vaccine administered, storage \\nconditions, etc.) may have varied between study countries, re-\\nsulting in different immunogenicity of the vaccine. Secondly, the \\nepidemiology of measles in various regions of the world is het-\\nerogeneous and the effect of a natural booster can consequently \\nvary, depending on the probability of coming into contact with \\nthe virus. Third, the students involved may not be fully represen-\\ntative of the population of origin, as they probably belong to the \\nupper social class.\\nConclusions\\nThe results of our study, although carried out on a small sample, \\nhighlight a concerning proportion of medical students who are \\nserologically non-immune to measles. Measles immunity rates \\nwere heterogeneous depending on the country of origin, raising \\nconcerns about the high risk of measles transmission among stu-\\ndents from areas with the lowest immunization rates. Although \\nthe sample size is limited, these initial findings can provide a \\nfoundation for future studies that aim to assess the immune status \\nof students in the medical area. Based on the reported data, there \\nis a strong indication to implement a mandatory immunization \\nschedule for HCWs at the time of their hiring. Considering the \\nlimited protection period for these vaccines, it could be recom-\\nmended that students receive a mandatory booster for these vac-\\ncines during the university course, particularly when working in \\nhigh-risk areas.\\n1.

It extends the horizons\\nof xenotransplantation beyond the breakthroughs achieved in\\nporcine heart and kidney grafts and aligns with the emergent\\nclinical data on porcine liver applications [1].\\nPioneering porcine heart transplants into terminal human re-\\ncipients demonstrated that genetic engineering and immuno-\\nsuppression could transiently forestall immune rejection [2, 3],\\nthough the patients finally did not survive for a number of rea-\\nsons related to infection. Likewise, porcine kidney grafts func-\\ntioned for several days post‐transplant in brain‐dead human\\nmodels [4]. Out of the four clinical cases transplanted so far, only\\none is reported to still function [5].\\nRecent forays into porcine liver xenotransplantation mark a\\nnew frontier. At Anhui Medical University, surgeons suc-\\ncessfully performed a heteroto pic auxiliary transplant of\\nag e n e‐edited pig liver into a living human liver cancer\\npatient (2024) [6]; the graft produced bile and demonstrated\\nfunction in vivo without acute rejection. Similarly, at Xijing\\nHospital, a genetically modified porcine liver was implanted\\ninto a brain ‐dead patient and maintained function for\\n10 days [7, 8]. These short ‐term successes, while prelimi-\\nnary, emphasize the growing momentum in xenotransplant\\nresearch [9, 10].\\nHe et al. used lungs from donors lacking α‑Gal, Neu5Gc,\\nand Sda antigens, alongside human complement regulators like\\nCD46 and CD55 [1]. These modifications mirror those used in\\nliver and renal models and underscore the importance of ex-\\ntensive glyco‐immunological tuning [10]. The Anhui auxiliary\\nliver case similarly employed 10‐gene‐edited pigs with multiple\\nhuman transgenes to temper immune activation [6].\\nPrimary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains a leading chal-\\nlenge in lung transplantation due to the organ's delicate\\nmicrovascular network. He et al. reported stable early lung\\nfunction post‐transplant, though longer‐term studies remain\\nnecessary [ 1]. In the liver context, thrombocytopenia and\\ncoagulopathy are prominent, driven by porcine vWF and\\ncross‐species incompatibility. Strategies integrating human\\nthrombomodulin and complement inhibitors have partially\\nmitigated this in preclinical models, but effective durability\\nremains elusive [10].\\nAnti‐CD40 monoclonal antibody use in He et al.'s protocol\\naligns with emerging preferences for targeted costimulation\\nblockade in xenografts. This contrasts with earlier reliance on\\nanti‐CD154, which was associated with thrombosis [11, 12].\\nThese strategies echo liver xenograft protocols, which have\\nbegun using tacrolimus, steroids, and B ‐cell depletion with\\npreliminary success and no acute rejection in the reported\\nChinese auxiliary and full size liver transplant case [6, 7].\\nWhile achievements in heart, kidney, lung, and auxiliary/full\\nsize liver xenografts are promising, translation into clinical\\nprotocols demands cautious progression, and global regulatory\\nframeworks [13–16].

Key measures included\\nselection of a patient newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, use of CGM, analysis of glucose trends and contributing\\nfactors, and patient guidance in maintaining a health diary and developing personalized self‐management strategies (e.g.,\\ndietary modification and exercise regimens). Following 6‐month CGM‐guided self‐management, the patient's glycated hemo-\\nglobin level decreased from 7.3% at baseline to 6.0% and his body weight decreased from 83 to 77 kg, a 7% reduction; thus, the\\npatient met the criteria for diabetes remission.\\nThe 2021 International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas re-\\nported that approximately 537 million adults aged 20–79 years\\nworldwide met the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, with type 2\\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM) constituting 90%–95% of cases [1].\\nWith the escalating prevalence of obesity, obesity‐associated\\nT2DM is also increasing rapidly, accounting for 60%–70% of all\\ndiabetes cases. Studies show that lifestyle interventions,\\nincluding dietary modification and physical activity, may result\\nin diabetes remission in overweight/obese patients with T2DM\\nwho have a short disease duration [2]. Self‐management is\\nrecognized as the cornerstone for preventing complications\\nand improving health outcomes in patients with T2DM, but\\nself‐management practices in these patients are reportedly poor.\\nA national survey among Chinese patients with T2DM reported\\nonly 25.7% consistently monitored blood glucose, 74.5% adhered\\nto dietary restrictions, and 12.8% engaged in regular physical\\nactivity [3]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a pivotal\\ntool in optimizing diabetes management that can motivate self‐\\nmanagement and improve glycemic control in patients with\\nT2DM [4, 5]. However, few studies have investigated the impact\\nof CGM‐guided self‐management on achieving glycemic control\\nand diabetes remission in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM\\nnot taking glucose‐lowering medications.\\nIn this case study, we present a newly diagnosed overweight\\npatient with T2DM who achieved diabetes remission through\\nCGM‐guided self‐management using a health diary and weight\\nmanagement strategies.\\nThis is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution‐NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original\\nwork is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.\\n© 2025 The Author(s).Health Care Sciencepublished by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd on behalf of Tsinghua University Press.\\nXia Yang and Xiu‐Dong Liu contributed equally to this study.\\n350Health Care Science, 2025; 4:350–354\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/hcs2.70035\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'creationdate': '2025-10-29T13:57:43+05:30', 'keywords': 'continuous glucose monitoring; diabetes remission; overweight; type 2 diabetes mellitus', 'moddate': '2025-11-06T14:44:34-08:00', 'subject': 'Health Care Science 2025.4:350-354', 'wps-proclevel': '3', 'wps-journaldoi': '10.1002/(ISSN)2771-1757', 'author': '', 'title': 'Continuous Glucose Monitoring‐Guided Self‐Management Leads to Diabetes Remission in a Newly Diagnosed Overweight Patient With Type 2 Diabetes: A Brief Report', 'wps-articledoi': '10.1002/hcs2.70035', 'source': 'data\\\\Health Care Science - 2025 - Yang - Continuous Glucose Monitoring‐Guided Self‐Management Leads to Diabetes Remission in a.pdf', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content=\"1 | Patient Information\\nThe patient, a 55‐year‐old man, had been engaged in light\\nphysical labor for an extended period. In March 2023, he was\\ndiagnosed with T2DM following a routine physical examination,\\nwith a fasting blood glucose level of 7.2 mmol/L and glycated\\nhemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.3%. The patient had no symptoms\\nof polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, or weight loss. He initially\\nattempted lifestyle modification and occasionally monitored his\\nblood glucose via fingerstick testing. However, his glycemic\\nvariability was substantial, and he did not achieve effective gly-\\ncemic control. In March 2024, the patient revisited the clinic after\\na physical examination showing a fasting blood glucose level of\\n7.26 mmol/L and HbA1c of 7.2%, indicating suboptimal glycemic\\ncontrol after 1 year of lifestyle adjustments.\\nThis patient had a 10‐year history of hypertension and had\\nexperienced acute myocardial infarction 5 years earlier,\\nfor which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention.\\nHe was taking long‐term antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and\\nlipid‐lowering medications. Physical examination revealed a\\nheight of 175 cm, weight of 83 kg, and body mass index of\\n27.1 kg/m\\n2. Pancreatic function tests showed a fasting C‐peptide\\nlevel of 3.5 μg/L and postprandial (2 ‐h) C‐peptide level of\\n15.5 μg/L. Complication screening indicated stage I retinal\\narteriosclerosis on fundus examination and moderate fatty liver\\non abdominal ultrasound.\\nDuring shared decision‐making, the patient admitted difficulty\\ntaking multiple daily medications and expressed a desire to\\nimprove his glycemic control through lifestyle interventions.\\n2 | Self ‐Management Intervention\\nThe 2024 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes published by\\nthe American Diabetes Association (ADA) highlight that dia-\\nbetes remission can serve as a potential therapeutic target for\\npatients with T2DM, especially in newly diagnosed individuals\\n[6]. The standards also emphasize that weight management is\\ncentral to self‐management in overweight patients with T2DM;\\nadditionally, CGM can reduce the risk of hypoglycemia\\nand enhance adherence to self ‐management in those with\\nsubstantial glycemic variability [6]. According to ADA stan-\\ndards, we established the following diabetes remission goals\\nfor this patient: achieving an HbA1c < 6.5% and maintaining a\\nfasting blood glucose within the target range after 6 months\\nof self‐management intervention, without the use of glucose‐\\nlowering medications. On the basis of DiRECT trial [7] findings\\ndemonstrating a 29% remission rate among patients achieving\\n7%–10% body weight reduction, we set the weight loss target at\\n7%–10% of the patient's initial body weight.\\n3 | CGM Monitoring and Health Diary Recording\\nCGM uses a sensor to monitor glucose levels in subcutaneous\\ninterstitial fluid, which reflects blood glucose trends. This\\napproach can help patients to understand the relationship\\nbetween glucose fluctuations and associated factors, such as\\ndiet and physical activity. CGM is critical in guiding dietary and\\nexercise adjustments, improving HbA1c, and reducing the risk\\nof diabetes‐related complications and cardiovascular diseases\\n[8]. Maintaining a health diary is shown to improve patient\\nbehavior and enhance self‐management awareness [9].\\nWith the patient's consent, a CGM device was worn for 8 days\\n(April 8th–15th); the patient was also instructed to maintain a\\nhealth diary over the same period. The content recorded in the\\ndiary included daily food intake (type, portion, and timing),\\nphysical activity (type, duration, and intensity), and any sub-\\njective discomfort symptoms (e.g., hypoglycemia). The CGM\\nresults revealed a time in range (TIR) of 67.5%–82.9% and a\\ntime above range (TAR) of 17.1%–32.5%, primarily occurring\\n1–2 h after breakfast and dinner, indicating significant post-\\nprandial glucose variability. A hypoglycemic episode (glucose\\n4.8 mmol/L) detected via CGM was identified as a measurement\\nartifact upon validation with capillary blood glucose testing,\\nconsistent with known interference factors in subcutaneous\\nglucose sensing (Figure1).\\n4 | Weight Management\\nFor newly diagnosed overweight/obese patients with T2DM,\\nthe cornerstone of self ‐management is weight control to\\nimprove insulin sensitivity. Based on the 2024 ADA Standards\\nof Medical Care in Diabetes, we implemented individualized\\nweight management measures for our patient, including dietary\\nand exercise interventions.\\nThe 2024 ADA standards emphasize that dietary management\\nshould be personalized, accounting for the patient's lifestyle,\\ndietary preferences, and baseline health status. Based on\\nCGM data analysis and communication with the patient, we\\nfound he preferred a high‐calorie diet comprising foods rich\\nin fats and carbohydrates; the composition of his daily diet\\nwas 2/5 at breakfast, 1/5 at lunch, and 2/5 at dinner. In shared\\ndecision‐making, dietary modifications were implemented\\nacross three key dimensions: (1) total caloric intake, (2)\\nmacronutrient composition ratios, and (3) food variety/\\nselection, based on evidence‐based nutritional guidelines for\\ndiabetes management. The pati ent's daily caloric intake\\ndecreased from 1800 to 2000 kcal to 1400–1500 kcal, his car-\\nbohydrate intake decreased from 300 g/day to 200 g/day, and\\nfat intake declined from 30 to 35 g/day to 25 g/day. At the\\nsame time, the patient consumed more low ‐glycemic‐index\\nvegetables and fruits and finally adjusted the composition\\nratio to 1/3 at each meal.\\nThe 2024 ADA standards highlight that it is important to make\\nindividualized exercise plans based on the patient's health sta-\\ntus and physical capabilities. In the assessment, we found that\\nour patient engaged in regular exercise. He undertook aerobic\\nactivities such as brisk walking and jogging five times a\\nweek for 30 min per session. In shared decision‐making, more\\nresistance training was added to enrich the exercise composition,\\nsuch as Baduanjin (a traditional Chinese exercise) twice a week\\nfor 30 min per session, alternating with aerobic activities.\\nWe suggested that all exercises be performed 1 h after meals.\\nThe patient was also advised to wear a fitness tracker to monitor\\nhis heart rate and blood pressure and to carry nitroglycerin\\n351\\n 27711757, 2025, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hcs2.70035, Wiley Online Library on [06/11/2025].
